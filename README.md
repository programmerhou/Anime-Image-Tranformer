Before run pic.py you need prepare to install UI tools called QTDesiginer

pip install qypt5

pip install qt5-tools

I uploaded these files if you don't have but  you also need pyside6 for operation
pip install pyside6 (or pyside2)



(Pycharm or Jupyter)find settings find Tools input your environment variables
