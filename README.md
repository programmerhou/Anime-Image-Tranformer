Before run pic.py you need prepare to install UI tools called QTDesiginer

pip install qypt5
pip install qt5-tools
I uploaded these files if you don't have but  you also need pyside6 for operation
pip install pyside6 (or pyside2)



(Pycharm or Jupyter)find settings find Tools input your environment variables

you also can adjust model.py file to change the threshold.
